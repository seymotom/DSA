 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 
 Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

/*
 
 Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input:
 "tree"
 
 Output:
 "eert"
 
 Explanation:
 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
 So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
 Example 2:
 
 Input:
 "cccaaa"
 
 Output:
 "cccaaa"
 
 Explanation:
 Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
 Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
 Example 3:
 
 Input:
 "Aabb"
 
 Output:
 "bbAa"
 
 Explanation:
 "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
 Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
